\section{Introduction}

Since the fortuitous discovery of the first pulsar \citep{hbp+68},
numerous radio surveys carried out in the last four decades
have unveiled about 2500 pulsars as of 2016.  Pulsars are highly
magnetized neutron stars with spin period ranging from a few
milliseconds to a few seconds that emit radio waves seen as a
succession of radio pulses for an observatory located on the Earth.
Out of these $\sim 2500$ pulsars known, $\sim 300$ are pulsars with millisecond
periods (referred as millisecond pulsars, MSPs).

The reason that large pulsar surveys are still conducted nowadays is
the wealth of informations that can be extracted from pulsar
observations, especially from millisecond pulsars and exotic binary
pulsars.  Some recent pulsar discoveries and subsequent monitoring
yielded the strongest constraints on theories of gravity \cite[PSR
  J0737$-$3039A/B,][]{ksm+06} and equation of state for dense matter
\citep[][]{af}.

An ensemble of MSPs spread over the celestial sphere has the potential
to directly detect gravitational waves. Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) in
Australia, Europe and North America have been established to lead this
effort. A key part to improve the sensitivity of a PTA is to increase
the number of MSPs suitable for inclusion in the PTAs.

Pulsar surveys are being carried out in almost all major radio
facilities at various observing frequencies. The list includes the
P-ALFA survey \citep{cfl+06,lbh+15}, the High Time Resolution Universe
(HTRU) North \citep{bck+13} and South \citep{kjs+10} pulsar surveys at 1.4\,GHz
and the Green Bank North Celestial Cap (GBNCC) pulsar survey at 350\,MHz \citep{slr+14}.

We report here on a new L-band pulsar survey with the Nan\c cay Radio
Telescope (NRT) referred to as the SPAN512 survey that began in 2012,
exploiting the new wide pulsar backend NUPPI \citep{dbc+11}. The NRT
has previously been engaged in pulsar surveys at \citep{frc+97} that
ultimately lead to the discovery of two new young pulsars
\citep{tpc+11}.

The plan of the paper is as follows. We describe the set-up of the
observations in section~\ref{sec:obs} and the processing pipeline in
section~\ref{sec:processing}. We present our discoveries in
section~\ref{sec:results}.

\section{Observations}
\label{sec:obs}

\subsection{Setup}

The SPAN512 survey is an intermediate latitude pulsar survey at L-Band whose sky
coverage ($3.5\degr < |b| < 5\degr$ and $\sim 74\degr < l < 150\degr$)
is delimited towards the inner Galaxy by the P-ALFA survey
\citep{cfl+06,lbh+15} and by the HTRU-North survey \citep{bck+13} in
longitude.

The observations are carried out with the NRT, a transit telescope of
Kraus design, and its low-frequency receiver tuned at a central
frequency of 1.466\,GHz. At this frequency, the system temperature is
$T_{\text{sys}} = 35$\,K, the nominal gain is $G=1.4$\,K\,J$^{-1}$ and
the half-power beamwidth (HPBW) is $4'$ (in right ascension $\alpha$) by $22'$ (in
declination $\delta$). However, due to the specific design of the
telescope, for $\delta > 25\degr$ the illuminated area of the mirrors
(and therefore the gain $G_\delta$) decreases as a function of the
source elevation. $G_\delta$ can be approximated by
\begin{equation}
G_\delta = 1.4938 \times G \times \sin \left(69.132-\delta/2 \right)^2.
\end{equation}
Conversely the HPBW  increases in $\delta$ as 
\begin{equation}
\text{HPBW}_\delta = 18' / \sin \left(69.132 - \delta/2 \right).
\end{equation}

% Beam description
\TODO: add rotation of the beam. Hopefully, we'll be able to ignore the rotation

A total of \NBeam beams are therefore necessary to cover the proposed sky area of the
SPAN512 survey.


The data are recorded with the versatile NUPPI backend \citep{dbc+11}
based on a CASPER\footnote{\url{https://casper.berkeley.edu}} ROACH
board. A 512\,MHz bandwidth is digitised using 8-bits
analog-to-digital converters and split into 1024 channels by a 8-tap
polyphase filter bank implemented onto the field-programmable gate
array board where chunks of 64 MHz of baseband data are processed by a
Graphics Processing Unit. The two linear complex polarisations from the receiver are
detected, summed together to form Stokes I, averaged in time every 64
\us and written to disk in \textsc{PSRFITS} 4-bits search mode. The 8
subbands are merged together using a modified version of the
\textsc{psrfits\_utils}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/demorest/psrfits_utils}}
tools. Each observation is 18 min long and 8.8\,GB in size and the total expected amount of data for the
survey is about 52\,TB.

As this survey was designe to achieve a similar sensitivity to the HTRU-N low-latitude survey, the integration time 
\begin{equation}
S = \frac{\text{S/N} \times (T_{\text{sky}} + T_{\text{sys}})}{G_\delta \sqrt{n_\text{p} t_{\text{obs}} \Delta f}}.
\end{equation}

Observations started early 2012. As of October 1st 2016, 5412 unique
sky pointings were acquired making the observing 90\,\% complete. The
characteristics of the survey are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:survey}
and Figure~\ref{fig:sky} shows the sky coverage of the survey.

% We describe in the next section

\input{table_survey}

  coordinates. The blue and red points represent the observed and
  missing beams for completion of the survey, delimited by the black
  rectangles. The yellow stars indicate the location of known pulsars
  in this part of the sky.}

\section{Survey processing}
\label{sec:processing}

The analysis was done using the \textsc{PRESTO}-based pipeline
described in \citet{lbh+15}.

\subsection{RFI excision}

The first step of the processing is to clean the data in chuncks of
0.5s for the presence of narrow-band Radio Frequency Interference
(RFI) with the \textsc{rfifind} tool from the \textsc{PRESTO} package.
is described in details in \citet{lbh+15}.
What is the fixed percentage of zapped data? Zaplist?

Figure~\ref{fig:rfi} shows the evolution of the data being masked due
to the presence of RFIs.  The median of the percentage of data masked
in each beam is $\sim$ 12\%. The observations that require to mask
more than 30\% of the data are rescheduled.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[height=\columnwidth,angle=-90]{plots/rfi.ps}
\caption{Percentage of data masked by \textsc{rfifind} in each pointing as a function of time}
\label{fig:rfi}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dispersion removal}
To mitigate the frequency-dependent dispersive delay for a pointing
with unknown DM, the data are dedispersed over a wide range of DM
trials. The spacing between two DM trials, $\delta_{\text{DM}}$ is set
by ... The limit of the DM trials is typically set to be a few times
(arbitrary number) the maximum DM value predicted by the
\textsc{NE2001} model. However, the cost of computing time greatly decreases with.
We chose here to dedisperse the data to a DM up
to 3000\,pc\,cm$^{-3}$. Table~\ref{tab:DD} for details of the
dedispersion stage as done with the \textsc{prepsubband} program.  The barycentric correction of the time series for
the Earth motion around the Sun is also performed during the
dedispersion stage.

\input{table_DD}

\subsection{Search}

Search to a zmax of 150. What is the acceleration? Possible orbits?

\subsection{Candidate folding}

After the sifting process we fold 150 candidates with sigma above 6.

\subsection{Candidate ranking and visualization}

A set of ratings is applied to each of the candidates, including the
likelihood \citep{lsj+13} and neural networks \citep{zbm+14}.
The training set is based on .
XX percent with a score between YY and ZZ.
